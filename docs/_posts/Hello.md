### Hello! I'm Ivan. 

I am serious about the sound in games. I love games, I have a large collection. I think games are serious, some games are art.
The sound in games is closely related to development, integration, data and sound. These are very interesting tasks.
I like a job as a sound designer. To work as a teams of open, enthusiastic people. 
To enjoy interesting, challenging tasks and to create a sound environment in worlds created with the soul.
