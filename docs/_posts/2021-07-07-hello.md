### I create and implement sound for video games. 

I love games, I have a large collection. I think games are serious, some games are art.
The sound in games is closely related to development, integration, data and sound. These are inspiring tasks for me.

Email me if you are looking for a sound designer, I would be pleased to solve your sound related needs.
