### I create and implement sound for video games. 

I graduated from Ural Federal University with a degree in Radio Engineering. 

Live on the Europe-Asia border, where I'm actively working as a sound designer. 

Email me if you are looking for a sound designer, I would be pleased to solve your sound related needs.
